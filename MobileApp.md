# Title
Mobile Application
## Context
The decision to utilize Firebase as the backend solution for our mobile application development project.

The need for a robust and scalable backend solution arose due to:

1. Scalability and Performance Concerns:

Current solution: Existing backend infrastructure struggles to handle increasing user base and data volume, leading to slow loading times and performance issues.

2. Cost Optimization:

Challenge: The current backend solution incurs high maintenance and operational costs.

## Decision
After careful consideration, we have chosen to leverage Firebase for its range of services that fulfill the important demands to develop mobile application, such as Realtime Database, Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage, and Hosting.


## Rationale
Firebase offer lots of tools and solution for complete backend service in their own. It's provide scalability in later. developer can start without cost and can extended their own budget later.

## Consequences
Pros – What becomes easier?
Cons – What becomes more difficult?

## Sample code
Give some sample code related to this decision.
