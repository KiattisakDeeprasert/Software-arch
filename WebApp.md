# Title
Web Application

## Context
The decision to utilize Firebase as the backend solution for our web application development project.

The need for a robust and scalable backend solution arose due to:

1. Long development time and resource constraints:

Challenge: Building and managing a custom backend from scratch requires significant development time and resources, delaying launch and stretching the team.

2. Lack of specific functionalities:

Current solution: The current backend lacks features like user authentication, real-time updates, or static file hosting, hindering desired app functionalities.

## Decision
Firebase provides a comprehensive set of tools and services that can significantly simplify the development process for web apps, allowing us to focus on building great user experiences. Therefore, we use Firebase to address the issue.
